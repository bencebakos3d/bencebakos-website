    <h2>Artist & Engineer</h2>
    <p>
      I started my carreer as a 3D Artist: creating cool visualizations of aircraft and trains. <br /> When I was working on web configurators, I quickly realized the importance of programming.
      <br />
      <br />I'm currently working as a 3D Generalist at 3DigitStudio.

  <h2>Best Of Both Worlds</h2>
  <p>My strong visualization background helps me a lot, especially with frontend tasks. Image adjustment is an everyday thing for me.</p>
